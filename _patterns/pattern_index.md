# AI Prompt Patterns for Creative Professionals

This directory contains a collection of AI prompt patterns specifically tailored for creative professionals. Each file offers a detailed guide on using a specific pattern to enhance your interactions with AI, enabling you to automate tasks, refine ideas, and explore new creative approaches.

## Overview

These patterns are based on recent research into AI prompt engineering, focusing on practical applications for modern creatives â€” writers, designers, marketers, entrepreneurs, etc.... By leveraging these patterns, you can bring more structure and creativity to your AI-powered projects.

## How to Use

- Each `.md` file in this directory provides a guide for an individual pattern.
- The files contain front matter metadata for easy integration into platforms like Notion or Obsidian, along with in-depth descriptions, examples, and tips.
