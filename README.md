# Unknown Arts: AI Learning Journey

Welcome to the companion repository for the Unknown Arts newsletter! This repo documents my exploration into the world of Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on learning, experimentation, and sharing insights with the community.

## üìñ Overview

This repository is a collection of my personal notes, experiments, and projects as I dive into AI. Expect a variety of content, including:

- Markdown files summarizing key concepts and findings
- Jupyter Notebooks with tutorials, code examples, and projects
- Scripts and other Python files for more focused coding exercises

## üîç What You‚Äôll Find Here

1. **Handbooks:** Practical reference guides for exploring AI concepts and putting them into practice.
2. **Walkthroughs:** Step-by-step explanations of AI topics, suitable for beginners and those looking to deepen their understanding.
3. **Experiments:** Explorations of different libraries, frameworks, and techniques in the AI ecosystem.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

For now, the files are organized as follows:

- **/patterns:** Markdown summaries of useful prompting patterns for AI tools like ChatGPT & Claude
- **/notebooks:** Jupyter Notebooks with in-depth explorations and projects
- **/scripts:** Standalone Python scripts and utilities
