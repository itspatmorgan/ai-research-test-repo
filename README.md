# Unknown Arts: AI Learning Journey

Welcome to the companion repository for the Unknown Arts newsletter! This repo documents my exploration into the world of Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on learning, experimentation, and sharing insights with the community.

## üìñ Overview

This repository is a collection of my personal notes, experiments, and projects as I dive into AI. Expect a variety of content, including:

- Markdown files summarizing key concepts and findings
- Jupyter Notebooks with tutorials, code examples, and projects
- Scripts and other Python files for more focused coding exercises

## üîç What You‚Äôll Find Here

1. **Handbooks:** Practical reference guides for exploring AI concepts and putting them into practice.
2. **Walkthroughs:** Step-by-step explanations of AI topics, suitable for beginners and those looking to deepen their understanding.
3. **Experiments:** Explorations of different libraries, frameworks, and techniques in the AI ecosystem.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

For now, the files are organized as follows:

- **/patterns:** Markdown summaries of useful prompting patterns for AI tools like ChatGPT & Claude
- **/notebooks:** Jupyter Notebooks with in-depth explorations and projects
- **/scripts:** Standalone Python scripts and utilities
- **/docs:** Additional notes & resources

This will evolve over time.

## üëã About Me

Hey, I'm Patrick!

I'm the creator of this repo and the writer behind [Unknown Arts](https://www.unknownarts.co) on Substack. What‚Äôs my writing like? Imagine if Seth Godin and Derek Sivers had a design brainchild.

You can also find me on [X](https://x.com/itspatmorgan), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itspatmorgan/), and [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@itspatmorgan).

I‚Äôve built a multidisciplinary career over more than a decade in tech:

- I designed UX for billion-dollar enterprise software startups
- I engineered software for a consumer finance behemoth
- And I crafted communication strategies for some of the world's top brands.

Design, engineering, and brand strategy ‚Äî together, they form a powerful skill set that helps modern creators excel.

This project is a way for me to explore practical uses of AI and share them with other creative professionals. I want to elevate our collective understanding of these transformative technologies and support creatives in our shared quest to create meaningful work that positively impacts the world.

Now, let‚Äôs get building!
